# Arduino Waiter Robot

![Waiter Robot]

## Overview

This Arduino-based waiter robot is designed to autonomously serve tables in a restaurant or any similar setting. It is equipped with the following features:

- **Table Selection**: Users can select the table they want the robot to serve by entering the table number on the keypad.

- **Table Display**: The robot's LCD screen displays the table number it's currently serving, ensuring clear communication.

- **Line Following**: The robot is capable of following a black line on the floor, allowing it to navigate through predefined paths in the environment.

- **Obstacle Avoidance**: It uses sensors to detect obstacles in its path and intelligently maneuvers around them to ensure a safe journey.

## Hardware Requirements

To build and replicate this project, you will need the following components:

- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
- Motor driver module
- Motors and wheels
- IR sensors (for line following)
- Ultrasonic sensors (for obstacle avoidance)
- Keypad module
- LCD screen (for displaying table numbers)
- Chassis and mechanical components
- Power source (batteries or power supply)

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file.

2. **Arduino IDE Setup**: Set up your Arduino IDE and ensure you have the required libraries installed for LCD, keypad, and motor control.

3. **Hardware Connections**: Connect the hardware components according to the provided schematics and pin configurations in the documentation.

4. **Upload Code**: Upload the Arduino code (`waiter_robot.ino`) to your Arduino board.

5. **Power Up**: Power up the robot and place it in the environment where it can follow a black line.

6. **Table Selection**: Use the keypad to select a table for the robot to serve. The LCD screen will display the selected table number.

7. **Autonomous Operation**: The robot will start following the black line to reach the selected table, avoiding obstacles along the way.

8. **Enjoy**: Enjoy watching your waiter robot in action!

## Customization

You can customize this project by:

- Modifying the line-following algorithm to suit your environment.
- Enhancing obstacle avoidance by adding more sensors or implementing advanced algorithms.
- Improving the user interface with additional features on the LCD screen.
- Experimenting with different chassis and designs for your robot.
